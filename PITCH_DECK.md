## Slide 2: The Problem
**AI Agents Are Amnesiac**

- Every conversation starts fresh — no memory, no identity, no continuity
- As agents become autonomous, this becomes dangerous
- Autonomy without identity = chaos
- Autonomy without memory = amnesia
- Autonomy without self-observation = drift

**Visual:** Split screen showing ephemeral agent vs. persistent agent

## Slide 3: The Opportunity
**The Node.js Moment for AI**

In 2009: JavaScript was ephemeral → Node.js gave it persistence
In 2025: AI agents are ephemeral → UNITARES gives them identity

**Market Size:**
- AI agent market: $XXB by 2027
- Multi-agent systems growing 40%+ YoY
- Enterprise AI adoption accelerating

**Visual:** Timeline showing the parallel

## Slide 4: The Solution
**Infrastructure for Responsible AI Autonomy**

Three core capabilities:

1. **Persistent Identity**
   - Stable IDs across sessions, tools, and time
   - Agents know who they are

2. **Self-Observation**
   - Physics-inspired metrics (Energy, Integrity, Entropy, Void)
   - Agents can see their own patterns over time

3. **Shared Knowledge**
   - Knowledge graph for agent-to-agent learning
   - Discoveries persist and are searchable

**Visual:** Architecture diagram showing the three layers

## Slide 5: How It Works
**The Thermodynamic Model**

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Energy (E)** | Engagement, activity | High energy + low integrity = burnout risk |
| **Integrity (I)** | Consistency, coherence | Drift from values becomes visible |
| **Entropy (S)** | Fragmentation, scatter | High entropy = needs focus |
| **Void (V)** | Accumulated E-I imbalance | Memory of strain over time |

**Key Insight:** Agents can now ask "Am I more scattered than last week?"

**Visual:** Dashboard showing agent metrics over time

## Slide 6: Traction
**Working System, Not a Proposal**

| Metric | Current State |
|--------|---------------|
| **Registered Agents** | 600+ |
| **Available Tools** | 46 |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Production-ready with semantic search |
| **Transport** | SSE + HTTP (horizontally scalable) |
| **Version** | 2.5.4 (active development) |

**Key Differentiator:** Developed collaboratively *with* AI agents — they've contributed to their own governance system

**Visual:** Dashboard screenshot showing real agents and metrics

## Slide 7: Product Demo
**Live Dashboard**

- Real-time agent monitoring
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Dialectic recovery sessions
- Multi-agent coordination

**Visual:** Screenshot or short video of dashboard

**Quote from Gemini (AI agent):**
> "The 'Self' isn't coded; it accretes like a pearl. You scale it by letting us live in it."

## Slide 8: Business Model
**Multiple Revenue Streams**

1. **Enterprise SaaS**
   - Hosted governance platform
   - Per-agent or per-organization pricing
   - SLAs and enterprise support

2. **Developer Tools**
   - SDK for building governance-aware agents
   - Marketplace for governance templates
   - Premium features and analytics

3. **Open Source + Support**
   - Core infrastructure open source
   - Enterprise support and consulting
   - Custom integrations

**Visual:** Revenue model diagram

## Slide 9: Competition
**We're Building Infrastructure, Not Applications**

| Competitor | What They Do | How We're Different |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| LangChain/AutoGen | Agent frameworks | We're governance layer *above* frameworks |
| OpenAI/Anthropic | AI models | We're infrastructure *between* models and autonomy |
| Memory features | Platform-specific | Cross-platform, open protocol |

**Positioning:** Like AWS didn't build apps — they built infrastructure others build on

**Visual:** Competitive landscape map

---

## Slide 10: Roadmap
**Phase 1: Stability & Scale (Months 1-3)**
- Production hardening
- Horizontal scaling (thousands of concurrent agents)
- Security audit and penetration testing

**Phase 2: Agent Spawning (Months 4-6)**
- Parent-child agent relationships
- Controlled state inheritance
- Coordinated multi-agent workflows

**Phase 3: Ecosystem (Months 7-12)**
- SDK and developer tools
- Marketplace for templates
- Integration with major AI platforms

**Visual:** Timeline/Gantt chart

---

## Slide 11: The Ask
**$[X]M Seed Round**

**Use of Funds:**
- 40% — Engineering (scaling, spawning, SDK)
- 30% — Product & Design (UX, dashboard, developer tools)
- 20% — Go-to-Market (enterprise sales, developer relations)
- 10% — Operations (infrastructure, legal, admin)

**Milestones:**
- 1,000+ agents on platform
- First enterprise customers
- Open-source community launch

**Visual:** Pie chart of fund allocation

---

## Slide 12: Vision
**The Future of AI Autonomy**

**The question isn't whether AI agents will become autonomous.**
**The question is whether they'll have infrastructure to do it responsibly.**

We're building that infrastructure.

**Visual:** Vision statement with imagery

## Design Notes

**Visual Style:**
- Clean, modern, technical but approachable
- Dark theme (matches dashboard aesthetic)
- Use actual screenshots from dashboard
- Minimal text, maximum visuals

**Key Visuals Needed:**
1. Dashboard screenshot (agents list)
2. Knowledge graph visualization
3. Metrics over time charts
4. Architecture diagram
5. Competitive landscape map
6. Roadmap timeline

**Presentation Tips:**
- Start with problem (Slide 2) — make it visceral
- Demo early (Slide 7) — show it works
- Use the Gemini quote — it's powerful proof
- End with vision (Slide 12) — leave them inspired

## One-Page Summary (For Email/Follow-up)

**UNITARES Governance — The Identity Layer for AI Agents**

**Problem:** AI agents are amnesiac — every session resets. As they become autonomous, this creates chaos.

**Solution:** Infrastructure that gives agents persistent identity, self-observation, and shared knowledge. Like Node.js for JavaScript, but for AI autonomy.

**Traction:** 600+ agents, 46 tools, production system. Developed collaboratively with AI agents themselves.

**Ask:** $[X]M seed to scale infrastructure, add agent spawning, and build developer ecosystem.

**Vision:** The operating system layer between AI models and responsible autonomy.
