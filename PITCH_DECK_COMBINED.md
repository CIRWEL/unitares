# UNITARES + Anima — Combined Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**UNITARES Platform**
*Governance for Embodied AI Agents*

Tagline: "The operating system for responsible AI autonomy"

UNITARES Governance + Anima (Lumen)

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Two Critical Gaps in AI**

**1. Governance Gap**
- AI agents are amnesiac — no memory, no identity
- Multi-agent coordination is chaotic
- No self-observation or drift detection

**2. Embodiment Gap**
- Most AI is disembodied — no sensors, no environment
- No learning from physical interaction
- No continuity between digital and physical

**Together:** We need governance for embodied agents

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
**Two Products, One Platform**

**UNITARES Governance**
- Identity layer for AI agents
- Self-observation and drift detection
- Multi-agent coordination

**Anima (Lumen)**
- Embodied AI creature
- Sensor integration (temperature, humidity, light)
- Subjective experience and learning

**The Platform:** Governance infrastructure that works for both digital and embodied agents

## Slide 4: UNITARES — How It Works
[Same as standalone deck]

## Slide 5: Anima — Embodied Intelligence
**Lumen: A Creature That Learns**

- **Sensors:** Temperature, humidity, light, pressure
- **Nervous System:** Calibrated responses to environment
- **Memory:** Associative learning from conditions
- **Voice:** Text-to-speech with emotional state
- **Identity:** Persistent across reboots

**Key Insight:** Embodied agents need governance too — they accumulate experience, drift, and need coordination

## Slide 6: The Combined Value
**Why Together?**

**For Developers:**
- Build governance-aware embodied agents
- Coordinate digital and physical agents
- Shared knowledge graph across modalities

**For Enterprises:**
- Governance platform for all AI agents
- From chatbots to robots
- Single source of truth

**For Research:**
- Test governance theories on embodied agents
- Study continuity across modalities
- Advance AI safety research

**Visual:** Architecture showing both systems integrated

## Slide 7: Traction
**Working Systems**

**UNITARES:**
- 600+ agents registered
- 46 tools available
- Production knowledge graph

**Anima:**
- Active creature (Lumen)
- 720+ awakenings
- Real sensor data and learning

**Combined:**
- Governance system managing embodied agent
- Shared knowledge graph
- Cross-modal learning

**Visual:** Dashboard showing both systems

## Slide 8: Market Opportunity
**Two Markets, One Platform**

**Agent Governance Market:**
- Multi-agent systems: $XXB
- AI safety/governance: Growing rapidly
- Enterprise AI platforms: Need coordination

**Embodied AI Market:**
- Robotics: $XXB
- IoT + AI: Massive growth
- Smart devices: Need intelligence

**Combined Opportunity:** First-mover in governance for embodied agents

## Slide 11: The Ask
**$[X]M Seed Round**

**Use of Funds:**
- 35% — UNITARES engineering
- 25% — Anima hardware/software
- 20% — Platform integration
- 15% — Go-to-Market
- 5% — Operations

**Milestones:**
- 1,000+ agents on UNITARES
- Lumen device launch
- First enterprise customers

---

## Slide 12: Vision
**The Future: Governed Embodied Agents**

We're building the infrastructure for a world where:
- AI agents have persistent identity
- Digital and physical agents coordinate
- Governance scales from chatbots to robots
- Agents learn from each other across modalities

**The question isn't whether AI becomes autonomous and embodied.**
**The question is whether they'll have infrastructure to do it responsibly.**

---

## Design Notes

**Visual Style:**
- Show both systems side-by-side
- Emphasize the integration
- Use real screenshots from both
- Show Lumen device prominently

**Key Differentiator:**
- Only platform doing governance for embodied agents
- Unique combination of digital + physical
- First-mover advantage
