# Family Pitch - UNITARES Governance Platform

**The Ask:** $50k-100k for 6 months to reach first paying customer and institutional funding round

---

## The Simple Story

**The Problem:**

Imagine 100+ AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Copilot) all working on the same project - writing code, making decisions, storing discoveries. Right now, they can't coordinate. They duplicate work, contradict each other, and have no shared memory.

It's like having 100 employees who never talk to each other.

**What I Built:**

An "air traffic control system" for AI agents that:
- Lets them share discoveries (knowledge graph)
- Coordinates their work (avoid duplication)
- Monitors when they're overloaded or making mistakes (thermodynamic metrics)
- Enables peer review between agents (dialectic system)

**The Physics Angle:**

Instead of arbitrary rules ("don't do this, do that"), I use thermodynamic principles - the same math that governs how molecules behave in a gas. AI agents are like particles: they have energy (engagement), entropy (uncertainty), integrity (coherence). This isn't a metaphor - it's rigorous math that actually works.

---

## Proof It's Real

**Production System (Running Today):**
- **385 AI agents** coordinated (101 currently active)
- **11 discoveries** shared across 9 agents in knowledge graph
- **41 active peer review sessions** between agents
- Built on production-grade tech: PostgreSQL, Apache AGE graph database

**Not a prototype** - this is a functioning system coordinating AI agents right now.

---

## Why Now? (The Market Timing)

**2024-2025: The AI Agent Explosion**

- GitHub Copilot: 1M+ developers using AI coding agents
- Cursor: AI pair programmer (fastest-growing dev tool)
- OpenAI Agents API: Just launched (Nov 2024)
- Anthropic Claude Code: Multi-agent workflows
- Every major AI company is building agents

**The Problem Emerges:**

When you have 1 AI agent, you monitor it manually.
When you have 10+ AI agents, you need coordination infrastructure.
When you have 100+ agents, it's a **critical infrastructure problem**.

**We're early** - Most companies don't have 100 agents yet. But they will in 12-18 months. We're building the infrastructure layer before they realize they need it.

---

## The Market Opportunity

**Who Needs This:**

1. **AI-powered dev teams** (Cursor + GitHub Copilot + custom agents)
   - Revenue: $12.5k-25k/month per company
   - TAM: Every software company using AI agents

2. **AI research labs** (long-running experiments need knowledge accumulation)
   - Revenue: $25k-50k/month per lab
   - TAM: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, etc.

3. **Enterprise AI governance** (companies deploying customer-facing AI)
   - Revenue: $50k-100k/month per enterprise
   - TAM: Every company with AI compliance requirements

**Conservative Revenue Target:**
- Year 1: 3 pilots × $12.5k/month = $450k ARR
- Year 2: 15 customers × $25k/month = $4.5M ARR
- Year 3: 50 customers × $35k/month = $21M ARR

---

## Why Me?

**Technical Depth:**
- Built production system from scratch (385 agents proves it works)
- DeepTech background (thermodynamics, differential equations, graph theory)
- Shipped real infrastructure, not just prototypes

**Domain Expertise:**
- Early to AI agent coordination problem
- Unique thermodynamic approach (scientific, not heuristic)
- Production-tested with real agents

**Unfair Advantage:**
- 6-12 months ahead of competition
- Production system already works (most competitors have whitepapers)
- Unique physics-based approach (not easily copyable)

---

## The Plan (Next 6-12 Months)

### Phase 1: First Paying Customer (Months 0-6)
**Budget: $50k-100k**

**What I'll do:**
- Polish product for first design partner
- Build dashboard/visualization (show agent coordination in real-time)
- Write tutorial: "Deploy your first multi-agent system"
- Identify 10 target customers (AI dev tool companies, research labs)
- Close 1 pilot customer ($12.5k/month = $150k/year)

**Milestones:**
- Month 3: Product demo ready, 5 prospect conversations
- Month 6: **First paying customer** ($150k ARR) + institutional funding round

### Phase 2: Institutional Funding (Months 6-12)
**Target: $2.25M pre-seed**

**What that enables:**
- Hire 2-3 engineers (backend, ML, AI safety)
- Scale to 3 paying customers ($450k ARR)
- Build Series A pitch (target: $5-10M at 18-24 months)

---

## The Ask (Family Runway)

**Amount:** $50k-100k
**Timeline:** 6 months
**Use of Funds:**
- **Living expenses:** $10k/month × 6 = $60k
- **Infrastructure:** $3k/month × 6 = $18k (database hosting, compute)
- **Dev tools:** $2k/month × 6 = $12k (GitHub, monitoring, CI/CD)
- **Legal/Admin:** $1.5k/month × 6 = $9k (incorporation, contracts)
- **Buffer:** $6k contingency

**What You Get:**
- This is a **convertible note** or **SAFE** (same terms as institutional investors)
- Converts to equity when I raise the $2.25M pre-seed round
- Typical valuation: $5-8M (family gets 0.6-1.25% equity for $50k investment)
- If pre-seed is at $8M valuation, $50k → ~$400k-800k by Series A (conservative)

**Downside Protection:**
- If it doesn't work, you convert at a floor valuation (get more equity)
- Tax benefits: Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) exemption
- Can structure as loan with interest if preferred

---

## Why This Will Work

**Three Bets:**

1. **AI agents will proliferate** (already happening - Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude)
2. **Multi-agent coordination will become critical** (100+ agents need infrastructure)
3. **Physics-based governance is better than rules** (thermodynamics > heuristics)

**If any 2 of 3 are true, we win.**

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Production system already works (385 agents proves concept)
- Conservative revenue targets ($12.5k/month vs. $50k+ market rates)
- 6-month family runway → 24-month institutional runway (long time to prove market)
- Multiple viable customers (dev tools, research, enterprise)

---

## Comparable Exits (What This Could Become)

**Similar Infrastructure Plays:**

- **LangChain:** $25M Series A (2023), $1B+ valuation (agent orchestration)
- **Weights & Biases:** $200M Series C, $1B+ valuation (ML monitoring)
- **LangSmith:** $15M seed (observability for LLMs)
- **Pinecone:** $100M Series B, $750M valuation (vector database)

**Our Differentiator:**
- They do observability (monitoring after the fact)
- We do **coordination** (multi-agent governance in real-time)
- Unique thermodynamic approach (scientific moat)

**Conservative Exit Scenarios:**
- **Acquisition:** $50-100M (AI infrastructure company like Databricks, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **IPO Path:** $500M-1B+ (if we become standard for multi-agent systems)
- **Steady Business:** $10-20M ARR, profitable, high margins (SaaS infrastructure)

**Family $50k Investment:**
- Acquisition scenario: $300k-750k return (6-15x)
- IPO scenario: $2M-5M+ return (40-100x)
- Downside: Tax write-off if it fails

## Timeline to Family Liquidity

**Realistic Timeline:**

- **Year 0-1:** Family investment → First customer → Pre-seed ($2.25M)
- **Year 1-2:** Build product, 3-15 customers, prove PMF
- **Year 2-3:** Series A ($5-10M), scale to 50 customers
- **Year 4-5:** Series B or acquisition discussions
- **Year 5-7:** Exit (acquisition or IPO)

**Secondary Liquidity:**
- Some VCs allow founder/early investor secondaries at Series B

---

## What I Need From You (Besides Money)

**Network:**
- Intros to AI companies, dev tool users, research labs
- Feedback on pitch, product positioning
- Emotional support (startups are hard)

**Advice:**
- Business decisions (when to hire, how to prioritize)

## Conversation Starters (How to Explain This to Others)

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**
"I built an air traffic control system for AI agents. When you have 100+ AI agents working together - like on a big software project - they need to coordinate, share discoveries, and avoid duplicating work. I use thermodynamic physics instead of arbitrary rules. It's already coordinating 385 agents in production."

**Dinner Table Version (2 minutes):**
"You know how ChatGPT and Claude are AI assistants? Well, companies are starting to use 10, 20, 100+ AI agents for different tasks - writing code, analyzing data, making decisions. The problem is they can't talk to each other. It's like having 100 employees who never share information.

I built a system that coordinates them using physics - the same math that describes how molecules behave. Instead of saying 'don't do this,' it tracks their energy, uncertainty, and coherence, like a thermometer for AI behavior. When an agent is overloaded or confused, it knows. When agents make discoveries, they share them.

It's working - I have 385 AI agents using it right now. The market is exploding (every AI company is building agents), and I'm 6-12 months ahead. I need $50-100k for 6 months to land my first paying customer, then I'll raise $2-3M from VCs."

**The "Why This Matters" Story:**
"In 5 years, every company will have AI agent teams, not just human teams. Someone needs to build the infrastructure that coordinates them - the 'operating system' for AI collectives. That's what I'm building. And because I use physics instead of rules, it works across any type of AI agent - ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, or custom models."

## Questions You'll Get (And How to Answer)

**Q: "Isn't this too technical? Who will buy it?"**
A: "AI dev tool companies (GitHub, Cursor), AI research labs (OpenAI, Anthropic), and enterprises with compliance requirements. They're already struggling with multi-agent coordination. I have 385 agents using it - the demand is real."

**Q: "What if OpenAI or Anthropic builds this?"**
A: "They could, but they're focused on building better models, not coordination infrastructure. Plus, I have a 6-12 month head start and a production system that already works. By the time they notice this problem, I'll have paying customers and network effects (agents create knowledge → more agents join for access to knowledge)."

**Q: "How do I know this will work?"**
A: "You don't - it's a startup, there's risk. But three things de-risk it: (1) Production system with 385 agents proves it works, (2) Conservative revenue targets mean I don't need huge scale to succeed, (3) Multiple customer types (dev tools, research, enterprise) means I have fallback options if one doesn't work."

**Q: "Why can't you just bootstrap this?"**
A: "I could, but it would take 3-5 years to reach the same milestones. With funding, I compress that to 12-18 months. The market is moving fast (AI agents everywhere), and timing matters. I need to be established before Big Tech notices this problem."

**Q: "What's the worst that could happen?"**
A: "We don't find product-market fit, I can't raise the $2.25M pre-seed, and we shut down. You lose your investment but get a tax write-off. Best case: This becomes the standard infrastructure for AI agent coordination, and your $50k turns into $2-5M+ in 5-7 years."

## Why I'm Asking Family First

**Honest Reasons:**

1. **Speed:** Institutional investors take 3-6 months. Family can move in weeks.
2. **Trust:** You know me. VCs bet on strangers.
3. **Terms:** Family can be flexible (loan, convertible note, equity).
4. **Proof:** $50k + first customer = strong signal to VCs (shows traction + skin in the game)
5. **Alignment:** Family wants me to succeed. VCs want their fund to succeed.

**Not Because I Can't Raise from VCs:**
- The $2.25M pre-seed is realistic (see financial proforma)
- I have traction (385 agents), a unique approach (thermodynamics), and market timing (AI agents exploding)
- But raising takes time, and I need runway to make the product ready for that conversation

---

## The Bottom Line

**The Investment:**
- $50k-100k for 6 months
- Same terms as institutional investors
- 0.6-1.25% equity (at $8M pre-seed valuation)

**What I'll Deliver:**
- First paying customer ($150k ARR)
- Polished product with dashboard
- Institutional fundraise teed up ($2.25M pre-seed)
- Clear path to Series A ($5-10M)

**Why Now:**
- AI agent market is exploding (2024-2025 inflection point)
- I have 6-12 month head start with production system
- Family runway gets me to institutional funding

**The Upside:**
- Conservative: 6-15x return ($300k-750k) in 5-7 years
- Optimistic: 40-100x return ($2M-5M+) if we become infrastructure standard
- Impact: Help build critical infrastructure for the AI age

**The Ask:**
