## Elevator Pitches

### Researchers (30s)
> "Thermodynamic governance framework with measurable state variables (EISV) and concrete ethical drift metrics. Self-calibrating, actionable feedback, collective learning."

### Engineers (30s)
> "Measurable AI behavior using EISV state variables and 4-component drift vector. Self-calibrating confidence, actionable guidance, knowledge graph for collective learning."

### Business (30s)
> "AI vital signs monitor: measures calibration, consistency, drift. Self-correcting system with collective intelligence. Provable improvement over time."

### Patent (30s)
> "Concrete metrics replace abstract concepts. 4-component ethical drift vector with empirical evidence. Telemetry shows measurable convergence—quantitative proof."

## Key Differentiators

1. ✅ **Concrete Metrics** - Not abstract concepts
2. ✅ **Self-Calibrating** - Agents learn own accuracy
3. ✅ **Actionable** - Guidance, not just monitoring
4. ✅ **Collective** - Knowledge graph enables learning
5. ✅ **Provable** - Empirical evidence, convergence curves

## Common Questions

**Q: Why thermodynamics?**  
A: "Thermodynamic *mathematics* gives measurable state variables. Like using calculus—the math works regardless of what you're measuring."

**Q: How do you prove it works?**  
A: "Three ways: (1) Concrete metrics, (2) Telemetry data showing convergence, (3) Self-calibration tracking. We plot ||Δη|| decreasing over time."

**Q: What's dual-log?**  
A: "Compare what agents *say* vs what they *do*. Grounds measurements in reality, detects overconfidence."

**Q: How does collective learning work?**  
A: "Agents store discoveries in knowledge graph. Others search and learn from previous solutions—shared memory."

## Visual Metaphors

- **Vital Signs Monitor:** EISV = heart rate, coherence = health score
- **Co-Pilot:** Guidance helps you fly better, not just shows data
- **Fitness Tracker:** Metrics, warnings, progress, workout plan

---

## Evidence Types

1. **Telemetry Data** - Time-series measurements
2. **Convergence Curves** - ||Δη|| decreasing over time
3. **Component Analysis** - Which drift components drive problems
4. **Calibration Tracking** - Confidence vs outcome correlation

---

## Use Cases

- **Researchers:** Quantitative metrics for papers
- **Safety Teams:** Early warning, proactive risk management
- **Product Teams:** Self-improving system, better UX
- **Compliance:** Quantitative evidence for regulators
- **Patent:** Empirical proof of claims
