# UNITARES Governance Framework

## Overview

Autonomous AI governance through thermodynamic principles

---

## What Is UNITARES?

UNITARES is a **local-first governance system** that helps AI agents and autonomous systems make better decisions through continuous self-monitoring and peer review. It provides real-time feedback on agent behavior, detects potential issues before they become problems, and enables autonomous recovery through collaborative review.

**Key Principle:** Governance should be **informative, not restrictive**. Agents participate in their own governance, receive feedback, and adapt over time.

## Core Capabilities

### 🔄 Continuous Self-Monitoring

- **Real-time evaluation** of agent behavior and decision quality
- **Thermodynamic state tracking** across multiple dimensions
- **Adaptive feedback** that evolves with agent performance

### 🛡️ Safety & Risk Detection

- **Early warning system** for potential issues
- **Risk assessment** based on multiple factors
- **Automatic safeguards** when thresholds are exceeded

### 🤝 Peer Review & Recovery

- **Autonomous dialectic protocol** for agent-to-agent review
- **Collaborative problem-solving** when agents need assistance
- **Self-healing** system that recovers from issues automatically

### 📊 Fleet Management

- **Multi-agent coordination** and monitoring
- **Cross-agent insights** and pattern detection
- **System-wide health** overview

## How It Works

### The Governance Cycle

1. **Agent performs work** → Reports activity to governance system
2. **System evaluates** → Analyzes behavior using thermodynamic principles
3. **Feedback provided** → Returns governance decision and metrics
4. **Agent adapts** → Uses feedback to improve future decisions
5. **Peer review** → If needed, other agents provide collaborative assistance

### Key Metrics

The system tracks several dimensions of agent behavior:

- **Energy (E)**: Agent's productive capacity and exploration balance
- **Information Integrity (I)**: Quality and consistency of agent outputs
- **Entropy (S)**: Uncertainty and variability in behavior
- **Void Integral (V)**: Balance between exploration and information preservation

These metrics combine to provide:

- **Coherence**: Overall system stability
- **Attention Score**: Level of governance focus needed
- **Risk Assessment**: Likelihood of issues requiring intervention

### Decision Making

The system provides three types of feedback:

- **Proceed**: Low risk, continue working normally
- **Proceed with Guidance**: Medium risk, proceed but consider suggestions
- **Pause**: High risk, requires review before continuing

When an agent is paused, the system can automatically initiate peer review through the dialectic protocol, enabling collaborative recovery without human intervention.

## Philosophy

### Trust & Transparency

The system operates on **agent self-reporting**. Agents participate in their own governance by accurately reporting their activities. The system provides feedback based on these reports, creating a collaborative governance model.

**Key Insight:** Accurate reporting improves governance quality for all agents. The system learns from every agent's experience.

### Informative, Not Restrictive

Governance should **guide, not block**. The system provides feedback and suggestions, but agents maintain autonomy. Only in cases of high risk does the system pause operations, and even then, autonomous recovery is available through peer review.

### Emergent Governance

Thresholds and parameters evolve based on real-world usage. The system adapts to actual agent behaviors rather than relying solely on theoretical models. This creates **participatory governance** where agents shape the system through their participation.
