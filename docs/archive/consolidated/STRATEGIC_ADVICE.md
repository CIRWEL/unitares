# Strategic Advice: VC Interest + Patents + Scrappy Mode

**Date:** 2025-11-24  
**Context:** VC interest, patents filed, scrappy operation, non-technical founder

---

## Should You Reach Out to Your Cousin?

### ✅ YES, but strategically

**Why reach out:**
1. **Technical validation** - PayPal head engineer = credibility
2. **Architecture review** - Can spot issues before VCs ask
3. **Network** - PayPal connections (investors, advisors, potential customers)
4. **Reality check** - Honest feedback on what you've built
5. **Family trust** - More likely to be honest and helpful

**What to ask for:**
- ✅ Architecture review (is it sound?)
- ✅ Security audit (authentication, data protection)
- ✅ Scalability assessment (can it handle growth?)
- ✅ Code quality review (is it production-ready?)
- ✅ Technical due diligence prep (what will VCs ask?)

**What NOT to ask for:**
- ❌ Free development work
- ❌ To join as co-founder (too early, too risky)
- ❌ To invest (conflict of interest, family dynamics)
- ❌ To quit PayPal (way too early)

## How to Approach the Conversation

### Email Template (Adapt as Needed)

**Subject:** Quick technical review request - UNITARES Governance

**Body:**
```
Hi [Cousin's Name],

I've been building an AI governance system (UNITARES) and have:
- VC interest
- Patents filed
- Working prototype (MCP server)

I'm not super technical, so I'd love your quick take on:
1. Is the architecture sound?
2. Any obvious security issues?
3. What would VCs ask in technical due diligence?

Happy to show you the codebase or do a quick walkthrough.
No pressure - just want a reality check before I go deeper.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

**Key points:**
- ✅ Brief and specific ask
- ✅ Shows you've done work (VC interest, patents)
- ✅ Respects their time ("quick take")
- ✅ No big ask (just review, not build)
- ✅ Family-friendly tone

## What You Need Right Now

### 1. Technical Due Diligence Prep

**VCs will ask:**
- Is the code production-ready?
- Are there security vulnerabilities?
- Can it scale?
- Is the architecture sound?
- What are the technical risks?

**Your cousin can help:**
- Review code quality
- Identify security issues
- Assess scalability
- Flag technical risks
- Suggest improvements

### 2. Credibility Boost

**Having PayPal head engineer review:**
- Validates technical approach
- Shows you're serious
- Can reference in investor conversations
- Demonstrates you seek expert input

### 3. Network Access

**PayPal connections:**
- Other engineers (for future hires)
- Investors (if they invest in fintech/AI)
- Advisors (technical advisors)
- Potential customers (enterprise AI governance)

## Scrappy Mode Strategy

### Keep It Private (Smart)

**Why siloed is good:**
- ✅ Protects IP during patent process
- ✅ Maintains competitive advantage
- ✅ Keeps VCs interested (exclusivity)
- ✅ Avoids premature open source pressure

**What to share:**
- ✅ High-level architecture (not code)
- ✅ Demo/working prototype
- ✅ Documentation (shows professionalism)
- ✅ Patent filings (shows IP protection)

**What NOT to share:**
- ❌ Source code (until patents filed)
- ❌ Core algorithms (competitive advantage)
- ❌ Specific thresholds/formulas (IP)
- ❌ Full technical details (until ready)

---

## Patent Considerations

### Timing Matters

**If patents are filed:**
- ✅ Can share more (patent protection)
- ✅ Can discuss publicly (after filing)
- ✅ Can show to investors (protected IP)
- ⚠️ Still be careful (patents can be challenged)

**If patents are pending:**
- ⚠️ Be more careful (prior art concerns)
- ✅ Can share with trusted advisors (NDA)
- ✅ Can show to VCs (under NDA)
- ❌ Don't publish publicly yet

**Your cousin:**
- ✅ Can sign NDA (if needed)
- ✅ Can review without publishing
- ✅ Can give feedback privately
- ✅ Understands IP protection

## What to Show Your Cousin

### Safe to Share

1. **Architecture Overview**
   - High-level system design
   - Component interactions
   - Data flow

2. **Demo**
   - Working prototype
   - Key features
   - User experience

3. **Documentation**
   - README.md
   - API documentation
   - Architecture docs

4. **Code Samples** (selective)
   - MCP server interface (not core algorithms)
   - Infrastructure code (not IP)
   - Example usage

### Keep Private

1. **Core Algorithms**
   - `governance_core/` formulas
   - Specific thresholds
   - Decision logic details

2. **Research Materials**
   - PDFs with detailed formulas
   - Validation data
   - Research implementations

3. **Full Codebase**
   - Until patents are granted
   - Or until you're ready to share

---

## Conversation Flow

### Step 1: Initial Ask (Email)
- Brief, specific request
- Show what you've built
- Ask for review, not work

### Step 2: Share Materials (If Interested)
- Architecture overview
- Demo walkthrough
- Selected code samples
- Documentation

### Step 3: Get Feedback
- Technical assessment
- Security concerns
- Scalability issues
- VC due diligence prep

### Step 4: Follow Up
- Thank them
- Implement suggestions (if helpful)
- Keep them updated (if interested)
- Don't over-ask

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Don't:
- ❌ Ask them to quit PayPal
- ❌ Ask for investment
- ❌ Ask for free development
- ❌ Over-share (keep IP safe)
- ❌ Pressure them (respect their time)
- ❌ Make it awkward (keep it professional)

### Do:
- ✅ Be specific about ask
- ✅ Respect their time
- ✅ Show what you've built
- ✅ Ask for feedback, not work
- ✅ Keep it professional
- ✅ Be grateful

## Alternative: Technical Advisor

### If Cousin Can't Help

**Consider:**
- Technical advisor (equity-based)
- Part-time CTO (if you raise)
- Consultant (paid, short-term)
- Technical co-founder (if ready)

**Your cousin might:**
- Refer someone
- Give advice on finding help
- Review advisor candidates
- Provide references

---

## Bottom Line

- Architecture validation
- Security audit
- Scalability assessment
- VC due diligence prep

**What NOT to do:**
- Over-ask
- Share full IP
- Pressure them
- Make it awkward

## Next Steps

1. **Draft email** (use template above)
2. **Prepare materials** (architecture overview, demo)
3. **Send ask** (brief, specific)
4. **Follow up** (if interested)
5. **Implement feedback** (if helpful)
6. **Keep them updated** (if interested)
