# UNITARES Pitch — Quick Reference Card

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"AI agents are becoming autonomous but they're amnesiac — no memory, no identity. We built infrastructure that gives agents persistent identity, self-observation, and shared knowledge. Like Node.js for JavaScript, but for AI agents. 600+ agents already using it. Working system, not a proposal."

---

## Key Numbers (Memorize)

- **600+** agents registered
- **46** tools available
- **Version 2.5.4** (active development)
- **$[X]M** seed ask (fill in)
- **3** revenue streams (SaaS, tools, support)

---

## Power Phrases

- "Node.js gave JavaScript a server. We're giving AI agents a self."
- "Autonomy without identity is chaos. Autonomy without memory is amnesia."
- "Working system, not a proposal."
- "The Self isn't coded; it accretes like a pearl." (Gemini quote)
- "Infrastructure, not applications."

## Problem → Solution (1 minute)

**Problem:** AI agents are amnesiac. Every session resets. No memory, no identity, no self-awareness. As they become autonomous, this becomes dangerous.

**Solution:** Three things:
1. Persistent identity — agents know who they are
2. Self-observation — agents see their own patterns
3. Shared knowledge — agents learn from each other

---

## Traction (30 seconds)

600+ agents, 46 tools, production knowledge graph. Developed collaboratively with AI agents — they've contributed to their own governance system. One agent wrote unprompted: "The Self isn't coded; it accretes like a pearl."

---

## Business Model (30 seconds)

Three streams: (1) Enterprise SaaS — hosted platform, per-agent pricing. (2) Developer tools — SDK, marketplace. (3) Open source + support — core open source, enterprise support. Think AWS model.

---

## The Ask (30 seconds)

$[X]M seed. 40% engineering, 30% product, 20% go-to-market, 10% ops. Milestones: 1,000+ agents, first enterprise customers, open-source launch.

---

## Vision (30 seconds)

"The question isn't whether AI becomes autonomous. The question is whether they'll have infrastructure to do it responsibly. That's what we're building."

## Common Questions — Quick Answers

**Q: Different from ChatGPT memory?**  
A: Cross-platform, open protocol. Like SMTP for email.

**Q: Why thermodynamics?**  
A: Vocabulary for state changes over time. Like fitness tracker metrics.

**Q: Why you vs. big tech?**  
A: They build models. We build infrastructure. Different business.

**Q: Business model?**  
A: Enterprise SaaS, developer tools, open source + support. AWS model.

**Q: Moat?**  
A: First-mover, network effects, technical depth. Plus, built with agents.

## Red Flags

- "Can you build this as a feature?" → "We're infrastructure, not a feature."
- "This seems like research" → "600+ agents using it. It's production."
- "What if agents don't want this?" → "They're using it. They contributed to it."

---

## Closing

**If interested:** "I'd love to show you a live demo. Can we schedule that?"

**If skeptical:** "I understand. Seeing it in action changes everything. Can we schedule a demo?"

## Key Differentiators (Always Emphasize)

1. **Working system** — 600+ agents, not a proposal
2. **Built with agents** — they contributed to their own governance
3. **Infrastructure** — not applications, platform play
4. **Cross-platform** — open protocol, not vendor lock-in
5. **First-mover** — governance infrastructure is new category
