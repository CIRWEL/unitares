## Remember

**You're not selling a product. You're selling a vision.**

The product (600+ agents) proves the vision is real.

The vision (responsible AI autonomy) is what gets investors excited.

Balance both. Lead with vision. Prove with product.

*Good luck! You've built something real. Now go tell the story.*
