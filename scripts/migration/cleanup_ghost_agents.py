"""
Clean up ghost agents — archived agents with no governance state.

Identifies agents with status='archived' and no rows in core.agent_state,
then hard-deletes them (sessions, identities, agents) in cascade.

Agents WITH state data are preserved for forensic value.

Dry-run by default. Pass --execute to apply.

Usage:
    python scripts/cleanup_ghost_agents.py          # dry-run
    python scripts/cleanup_ghost_agents.py --execute # apply
