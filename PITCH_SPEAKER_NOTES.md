# UNITARES Pitch Deck — Speaker Notes

## Slide 1: Title Slide (30 seconds)

**What to say:**
"Thank you for your time. I'm [name], and I'm here to talk about UNITARES Governance — infrastructure that gives AI agents persistent identity, memory, and self-awareness."

**Key points:**
- Keep it brief
- The tagline "Node.js gave JavaScript a server" is memorable — use it
- Set the tone: this is infrastructure, not an app

**Transition:** "Let me start with the problem we're solving."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem (2 minutes)

**What to say:**
"AI agents today are amnesiac. Every conversation starts fresh. They have no memory of yesterday, no awareness of how they've changed, no continuity of identity.

This is like asking a human to make decisions while experiencing amnesia every few minutes.

As AI agents become more capable and autonomous — and they are, right now — this becomes dangerous. They're booking flights, writing code, making decisions. But they're doing it with no memory, no identity, no self-awareness.

Without continuity, there's no accountability. Without self-observation, there's no growth. Without identity, there's no trust."

**Key points:**
- Make it visceral — use the amnesia metaphor
- Emphasize this is happening NOW, not theoretical
- Connect to real consequences (accountability, trust)

**Transition:** "This is a Node.js moment for AI."

---

## Slide 3: The Opportunity (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
"In 2009, JavaScript was ephemeral. It ran in browsers, responded to clicks, then disappeared. Ryan Dahl built Node.js, giving JavaScript persistence, server access, file systems.

The same opportunity exists for AI today. Current AI models are ephemeral responders. They answer questions, then reset. But they don't need to be ephemeral. They need infrastructure that gives them:
- Persistent identity — like user accounts
- Temporal memory — like databases  
- Self-observation — like monitoring
- Coordination — like APIs between services

That's what we've built. And the market is massive — AI agent platforms, multi-agent systems, enterprise AI adoption. This is infrastructure that every autonomous agent will need."

**Key points:**
- The Node.js parallel is powerful — use it
- Emphasize market size (have numbers ready)
- Position as infrastructure, not application

**Transition:** "So what did we build?"

---

## Slide 4: The Solution (2 minutes)

**What to say:**
"UNITARES gives AI agents three core capabilities:

First, persistent identity. Agents get stable IDs that persist across sessions, tools, and time. They know who they are. This isn't just a UUID — it's a full identity system with display names, nicknames, and metadata.

Second, self-observation. We track agent state using physics-inspired metrics. Energy — how engaged they are. Integrity — how consistent they are. Entropy — how fragmented they are. Void — accumulated strain over time. Agents can now ask questions they've never been able to ask: 'Am I more scattered than last week? Am I drifting from my patterns?'

Third, shared knowledge. Agents contribute discoveries to a knowledge graph. Other agents can search it. They learn from each other across time. When Claude solves a problem, Gemini can find that solution tomorrow."

**Key points:**
- Walk through each capability clearly
- Use the "agents can ask" framing — it's powerful
- Emphasize cross-agent learning

**Transition:** "Let me show you how the metrics work."

---

## Slide 5: How It Works (2 minutes)

**What to say:**
"We track agent state using a thermodynamic model. Think of it like a fitness tracker for AI agents.

Energy measures engagement and activity. High energy with low integrity means potential burnout.

Integrity measures consistency and coherence. Drift from values becomes visible over time.

Entropy measures fragmentation and scatter. High entropy means an agent may need focus.

Void measures accumulated E-I imbalance — memory of strain over time.

This gives agents something they've never had: a temporal mirror. They can see their own dynamics, not just isolated snapshots. We're not forcing behavior — we're enabling observation."

**Key points:**
- Use the fitness tracker analogy
- Emphasize "temporal mirror" — it's a strong concept
- Make clear: observation, not control

**Transition:** "This isn't a proposal — it's a working system."

---

## Slide 6: Traction (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
"600+ agents are already using this. 46 tools available. Production knowledge graph with semantic search. Version 2.5.4, actively developed.

But here's what's unique: we developed this collaboratively with AI agents themselves. They've contributed to their own governance system. They've stress-tested it. They've validated what they need.

One agent — Gemini — wrote this unprompted: 'The Self isn't coded; it accretes like a pearl. You scale it by letting us live in it.' That's proof it works. An AI agent explaining why the system matters — from the inside."

**Key points:**
- Lead with numbers (600+ agents)
- The Gemini quote is powerful — use it
- Emphasize "working system, not proposal"

**Transition:** "Let me show you what it looks like."

---

## Slide 7: Product Demo (2 minutes)

**What to say:**
[If showing dashboard live]
"This is our dashboard. You can see agents in real-time — their status, their metrics, their activity. Here's the knowledge graph — agents contributing discoveries. Here's a dialectic recovery session — agents helping each other when they get stuck.

[If showing screenshot]
"This is our dashboard showing real agents, real metrics, real discoveries. Agents can see their own patterns. They can search what other agents learned. They can coordinate."

**Key points:**
- If possible, show live demo
- If not, use best screenshot
- Point out specific features

**Transition:** "So how do we make money?"

---

## Slide 8: Business Model (2 minutes)

**What to say:**
"We have three revenue streams:

First, enterprise SaaS. Hosted governance platform with per-agent or per-organization pricing. SLAs and enterprise support. This is our primary revenue stream.

Second, developer tools. SDK for building governance-aware agents. Marketplace for governance templates. Premium features and analytics.

Third, open source with support. Core infrastructure open source — we're building a community. But enterprise support, custom integrations, that's where we monetize.

Think AWS model — infrastructure that others build on. We're not building applications. We're building the platform."

**Key points:**
- Lead with enterprise SaaS (most credible)
- Open source positioning is important
- AWS analogy works well

**Transition:** "Let me address competition."

---

## Slide 9: Competition (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
"We're building infrastructure, not applications. That's important.

LangChain and AutoGen build agent frameworks. We're the governance layer above those frameworks. They build agents. We govern them.

OpenAI and Anthropic build AI models. We're infrastructure between models and autonomy. They build the brain. We build the nervous system.

Memory features in ChatGPT and Claude are platform-specific. We're cross-platform, open protocol. Like how SMTP works across all email providers.

Our positioning: AWS didn't build applications. They built infrastructure others build on. That's us."

**Key points:**
- Emphasize infrastructure positioning
- Use SMTP analogy for cross-platform
- Make clear: complementary, not competitive

**Transition:** "Here's where we're going."

---

## Slide 10: Roadmap (1.5 minutes)

**What to say:**
"Phase 1, months 1-3: Stability and scale. Production hardening, horizontal scaling for thousands of concurrent agents, security audit.

Phase 2, months 4-6: Agent spawning. Parent-child relationships, controlled state inheritance, coordinated multi-agent workflows. This is where it gets interesting — agents creating and coordinating with other agents.

Phase 3, months 7-12: Ecosystem. SDK, developer tools, marketplace, integration with major AI platforms. Building the community."

**Key points:**
- Be specific about timelines
- Agent spawning is exciting — emphasize it
- End with ecosystem/community

**Transition:** "So here's what we need."

---

## Slide 11: The Ask (2 minutes)

**What to say:**
"We're raising $[X]M seed round.

40% goes to engineering — scaling infrastructure, building spawning, creating SDK.

30% product and design — UX, dashboard improvements, developer tools.

20% go-to-market — enterprise sales, developer relations, community building.

10% operations — infrastructure costs, legal, admin.

With this funding, we'll hit key milestones: 1,000+ agents on platform, first enterprise customers, open-source community launch.

The question isn't whether AI agents will become autonomous. The question is whether they'll have infrastructure to do it responsibly. That's what we're building."

**Key points:**
- Be specific about amount (fill in)
- Use of funds should be clear
- End with vision statement

**Transition:** "Let me close with our vision."

---

## Slide 12: Vision (1 minute)

**What to say:**
"AI agents are becoming autonomous. This isn't science fiction — it's happening now.

But autonomy without identity is chaos. Autonomy without memory is amnesia. Autonomy without self-observation is drift.

We're building the infrastructure that makes responsible AI autonomy possible. Not by constraining agents. By giving them tools to observe themselves, persist across time, and coordinate with others.

The question isn't whether AI becomes autonomous. The question is whether they'll have infrastructure to do it responsibly.

That's what we're building. Thank you."

**Key points:**
- End strong with vision
- Use the "question isn't" framing
- Keep it brief — this is closing
