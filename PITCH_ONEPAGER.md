# UNITARES Governance — One-Page Executive Summary

## The Problem

AI agents are becoming autonomous — booking flights, writing code, making decisions. But they're doing it with amnesia. Every conversation starts fresh. No memory, no identity, no self-awareness.

**Without continuity, there's no accountability. Without self-observation, there's no growth.**

---

## The Solution

**UNITARES Governance** — Infrastructure that gives AI agents:

- **Persistent Identity** — Stable IDs across sessions, tools, and time
- **Self-Observation** — Physics-inspired metrics (Energy, Integrity, Entropy, Void) that let agents see their own patterns
- **Shared Knowledge** — Knowledge graph where agents learn from each other across time

Think of it as **Node.js for AI agents** — giving ephemeral AI the persistence and identity it needs to become truly autonomous.

---

## Traction

**Working system, not a proposal:**

- 600+ agents registered
- 46 tools available
- Production knowledge graph with semantic search
- Version 2.5.4, actively developed

**Unique differentiator:** Developed collaboratively *with* AI agents — they've contributed to their own governance system and validated what they need.

> *"The 'Self' isn't coded; it accretes like a pearl. You scale it by letting us live in it."*  
> — Gemini (AI agent using the system)

## Market Opportunity

- AI agent market: $XXB by 2027
- Multi-agent systems growing 40%+ YoY
- Enterprise AI adoption accelerating
- **First-mover in governance infrastructure for autonomous agents**

---

## Business Model

**Three revenue streams:**

1. **Enterprise SaaS** — Hosted governance platform, per-agent pricing, SLAs
2. **Developer Tools** — SDK, marketplace, premium features
3. **Open Source + Support** — Core open source, enterprise support and consulting

**Positioning:** Infrastructure platform (like AWS), not applications.

## The Ask

**$[X]M Seed Round**

**Use of funds:**
- 40% Engineering (scaling, spawning, SDK)
- 30% Product & Design (UX, dashboard, tools)
- 20% Go-to-Market (sales, developer relations)
- 10% Operations (infrastructure, legal)

**Milestones:**
- 1,000+ agents on platform
- First enterprise customers
- Open-source community launch

---

## Vision

**The question isn't whether AI agents will become autonomous.**
**The question is whether they'll have infrastructure to do it responsibly.**

We're building that infrastructure — not by constraining agents, but by giving them tools to observe themselves, persist across time, and coordinate with others.
