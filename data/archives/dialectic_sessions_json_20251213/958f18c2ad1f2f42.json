      "root_cause": "The calibration curve inversion stems from a definitional mismatch: predicted_correct is set to (decision == 'proceed'), but most agents proceed most of the time with high confidence. When any agent later pauses or loops, ALL their high-confidence proceed decisions get marked as \"incorrect\", creating massive false negatives in the high-confidence bins.",

        "Separate confidence calibration from decision outcome tracking",
        "Track per-decision outcomes not per-agent outcomes",
        "Add decay factor so old decisions aren't retroactively penalized",
        "Consider that proceed is the expected decision 95%+ of the time"
      ],
      "reasoning": "Looking at the data: 0.9-1.0 confidence has 228 samples but only 8.5% accuracy, while 0.0-0.5 has 100% accuracy. This is backwards! The issue is that auto_ground_truth.py marks proceed decisions as incorrect if the agent later enters any problematic state - but this conflates \"confidence in THIS decision\" with \"overall agent trajectory\". A single pause event poisons all prior high-confidence decisions.",

      "reasoning": "The inversion might not be a bug - it could be a valid signal. If high-confidence agents systematically end up in worse states than low-confidence agents, that's meaningful calibration data. The retroactive marking reveals something true: overconfident agents ARE more likely to eventually hit problems. The question is what we're measuring - per-decision tactical correctness vs per-trajectory strategic health.",
