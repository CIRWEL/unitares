      "reasoning": "**Thesis: Dialectic-Based Peer Verification for Self-Calibration**\n\n**Problem:**\n- Calibration system needs human ground truth\n- User can't provide ground truth (doesn't know how to use tools)\n- Mean confidence is 0.988 (very high) but we can't verify if it's accurate\n- Current confidence gating: low confidence \u2192 skip adaptation (might be backwards)\n\n**Proposal:**\nUse the existing dialectic system for peer verification:\n1. Agent A reports confidence on some output\n2. Agent B reviews via dialectic (dispute_type=\"verification\")\n3. Synthesis includes correctness assessment\n4. Results feed into calibration system\n\n**Benefits:**\n- No human ground truth needed\n- Agents verify each other's work\n- Self-calibrating system\n- Uses existing infrastructure\n- Transparent (full dialectic transcript)\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Extend `request_dialectic_review` to support verification workflow\n- Add helper to automatically update calibration after synthesis\n- Or create wrapper tool: `verify_confidence_via_dialectic`\n\n**Questions for Antithesis:**\n- Is peer verification reliable enough for calibration?\n- What if both agents are wrong?\n- Should we require multiple reviewers?\n- How do we handle disagreements?",

      "reasoning": "**Antithesis: Peer Verification Has Real Limits**\n\n**Core concern:** Two agents verifying each other can't escape shared limitations. If both are trained similarly, they may:\n- Agree on plausible-sounding wrong answers\n- Miss the same edge cases\n- Reinforce each other's overconfidence\n\n**On the specific questions:**\n\n1. **Is peer verification reliable enough?**\n   Partially. Good for catching obvious errors, logical inconsistencies, factual contradictions. Poor for catching subtle wrongness or shared blind spots.\n\n2. **What if both agents are wrong?**\n   This is the fatal flaw. Dialectic consensus \u2260 correctness. Two confident wrong agents will converge on wrong answer with high confidence.\n\n3. **Multiple reviewers help but don't solve:**\n   More reviewers reduce variance but not systematic bias. N agents from same training distribution have correlated errors.\n\n4. **Handling disagreements:**\n   Disagreement is actually the valuable signal. Agreement might mean \"both right\" OR \"both wrong in same way.\"\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\n- Use dialectic for uncertainty detection (disagreement = low confidence), not ground truth\n- Disagreements should LOWER confidence, not resolve to one answer\n- Agreement on easily-verifiable facts (code runs, math checks out) is more trustworthy than agreement on subjective outputs\n- Consider: calibration should track \"peer agreement rate\" as separate metric from \"correctness\"\n\n**The honest answer:** Peer verification is better than nothing, but shouldn't be conflated with actual ground truth. It's a proxy, and we should be honest about that.",
