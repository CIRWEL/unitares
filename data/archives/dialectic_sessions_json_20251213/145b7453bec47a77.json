      "reasoning": "The paradoxes ARE features, not bugs - but with important caveats. Each paradox represents a fundamental tension that CANNOT be fully resolved, only balanced:\n\n1. **Self-reporting**: Gaming is mitigated by derived metrics (complexity from behavior, not claims)\n2. **Phase-aware thresholds**: Context-sensitivity IS the feature - same state, different risk profiles\n3. **Meta-governance**: Hard limits (HARD_STOP) exist precisely because some boundaries shouldn't be negotiable\n4. **Convergence**: Dialectic protocol handles disagreement through synthesis, not forced agreement\n5. **Timeout**: Better to force a decision than infinite loops - premature > never\n\nThe key insight: These aren't paradoxes to SOLVE but tensions to NAVIGATE. The system's robustness comes from acknowledging these tensions explicitly rather than pretending they don't exist.",
